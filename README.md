Please complete the problems on the assignment page as follows.

---

### Instructions
- In the groupstrategies.py file, write <ins>at least 1 function</ins>.
     - You only have to submit the functions that you write as the "driver" in pair programming.
     - <ins>Between you and your partner/group members, you should have a total of 3 strategies submitted</ins>.
     - The functions should be named with the team name that you decided on together, then number your strategies 1-3. 
        - For example, if your team name is Red Wings, your function names should be `redWingsStrategy1()`,  `redWingsStrategy2()`, and `redWingsStrategy3()`.
     - Describe each of your strategies in comments above each function.
     - **You and your partners' function names should be different**!
- When you are finished, be sure to sync (commit and push) your code to GitHub

### Tips
- Get in touch with your group early!
    - The earlier you start, the more time you have to figure out our schedules and find time to meet.
- Test your code. 
    - Find good stopping points to test out bits of code and
    functions even when your program is only partially finished. 
    - Try out different inputs and see if you expect the outputs that you get. Create your own history lists for this!
- Ask for help on Twist, or feel free to talk to your group members. 
    - Remember that we are traveling together on this 
    learning journey and you don't have to struggle alone!
    - It is way more important that you get your questions answered than it is
    for you to have a perfectly working program
- Try some [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).
    - Find a rubber duck, or a pet rock, a stuffed animal, a figurine, a patient dog.
    - Explain your program, line by line, to the victim of your choice.
    - Sometimes this helps you think through your code and how it works, and 
    can help you find bugs and errors in your code.
- DO NOT COPY/PASTE CODE unless otherwise instructed to.
    - The purpose of these exercises is for you to practice your programming skills.
    - You will only harm yourself if you do not make the effort to understand the
    programming concepts we are covering.
